# presspress

An attempt to make a CMS in node.js based on the good parts of WordPress.
Expect absolutely nothing to be finished. Not even the name "presspress" is
final and will definitely change.

To try it out:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ahultgren/presspress.git [projectFolder]
$ cd [projectFolder]/demo
$ node .
```
